# Project

## Description

Welcome to the home page of `Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Profiler for .NET`.

## Get Started
### Step 0: Prerequisites
- **.NET 8 SDK**: Install the latest .NET Core SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet).
- **Local authentication**: Ensure local authentication is enabled for the Application Insights resource.

### Step 1: Create an ASP.NET Core Application
If you don't have an app already, you can create a new web API project using the following command:
```sh
dotnet new web
```

### Step 2: Add NuGet Package Reference
Add a reference to the latest NuGet packages:
```sh
dotnet add package Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Profiler.AspNetCore --prerelease
```
This will automatically add a dependency to `Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore`.

### Step 3: Enable Application Insights with OpenTelemetry
Follow the [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable?tabs=aspnetcore#enable-opentelemetry-with-application-insights) to enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry for .NET. 

Verify that the connection to Application Insights works -- [Confirm Data is Flowing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable?tabs=aspnetcore#confirm-data-is-flowing).

### Step 4: Enable Profiler
Append the call to `UseProfiler()` in your code:
```csharp
using Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Profiler.AspNetCore;

...

builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
        .UseAzureMonitor()
        .UseProfiler();  // Append this line

...
```

### Step 5: Run Your Application
Run your application and check the log output. A successful execution will look like this:
```sh
PS > dotnet run
