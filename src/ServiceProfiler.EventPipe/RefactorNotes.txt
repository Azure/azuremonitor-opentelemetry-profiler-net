Major refactor notes:

1. Stopped reference from `ServiceProfiler.EventPipe.Orchestration` to `ServiceProfiler.EventPipe.Client`.
   It should be the otherway around since the beginning.

2. Change ResourceUsageSource implemenation.
  The chnage has been make to OTel Profiler. See https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DevDivDiagnosticServices/_layouts/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={00EEA8E9-28E5-490D-A515-081C61F7710A}&wd=target%28EventPipe%20Profiler.one%7C29C7BE14-7573-4D48-80CC-258217574C4A%2FSimplified%20Metrics%20Providers%7C42A3308E-B87D-4ACD-9148-8E6DA1F227A0%2F%29&wdpartid={4F6F7FAE-EE4B-0256-3780-04AF0C3BC15D}{1}&wdsectionfileid={A55539E6-4ABD-44BE-B9D7-3587731F2723} for design details.
  [ ] Switch to use the new implemenation
  [ ] Wire up the service registration
  [ ] Tests

3. Correct expiration policy
  The expiration policy has been corrected to concreate types than using the interface.
  For example, stop using `IExpirationPolicy`, instead use `ProcessExpirationPolicy` or even policy factory to create very specific expiration policies.

    [ ] Wire up the service registration
        * ProcessExpirationPolicy needs to be regsistered
        * Factories for expiration policies need to be registered
    [ ] Tests

4. Redo the service profiler provider to leverage the new PostProfilerProcessor.

5. The IAuthTokenProvider is reimplemented
    Note: The way to get the credntial object is different because they live in differnet objects between the otel and the app insights sdk implemenation.
    [ ] Test when AAD auth is enforced.

6. Reuse the new PostProfilerProcessor to handle the post processing of the profiler data.
    [ ] Making sure the metadata - espcially the file format metadata is correctly set.
    [ ] Making sure the post processing is done correctly.
    [ ] Tests

7. "EP_OTEL_PROFILER" be removed.
    [ ] This was there to workaround new files in share bleeding back to the ServiceProfiler repo. It is now not needed.

8. Use the new implemenation for fetching role name and role instance.
    [ ] Tests
